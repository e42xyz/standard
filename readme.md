# The Standard theme by seismicthemes

This theme is absolutely beautiful, it features two stacked customizable menus.
Sticky “featured” post, clean lines, with easy to read fonts. It also supports
six widgetized areas so you will be able to position your content just how you
want it. Like to post pictures? No problem, standard has that covered too.
Standard theme supports custom image galleries so you can really show of your
pictures.

 * Stacked menus
